# My-Portfolio
As a web developer, having a functioning portfolio for possible employers to view is essential.  As such, over the last week I have been working on building my own portfolio website.

This project has not been an easy one, as although the html for the site is fairly easy to construct, as a new web developer I am still struggling a bit on proper css usage.
But I do have a general website mostly consturcted now with a few features.
