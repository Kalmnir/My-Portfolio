# My-Portfolio
As a web developer, having a functioning portfolio for possible employers to view is essential.  As such, over the last week I have been working on building my own portfolio website.  I also intend to continue updating this readme and the website itself over the months and years as my skills grow and I complete more projects.


## Features of the website

```
-Functioning nav bar to take users to appropriate sections of site.
-A link leading to my first project I completed, that being the re-factoring of the horiseon website code.
-Place holder images placed on the site for use until I have more completed projects to showcase.
-Links leading to my social medias as a way to contact me.
-Integration of CSS code that changes aspects of the page depending on the resolution of the device it's being viewed on.

```
