# My-Portfolio
As a web developer, having a functioning portfolio for possible employers to view is essential.  As such, over the last week I have been working on building my own portfolio website.

This project has not been an easy one, as although the html for the site is fairly easy to construct, as a new web developer I am still struggling a bit on proper css usage.
But I do have a general website mostly consturcted now with a few features.

## Features of the website

```
-Functioning nav bar to take users to appropriate sections of site.
-A link leading to my first project I completed, that being the re-factoring of the horiseon website code.
-Place holder images placed on the site for use until I have more completed projects to showcase.
-Links leading to my social medias and email as a way to contact me.

```
